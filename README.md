# UK Railway Stations Information Boards
This project plans to recreate passenger information boards used in UK railway stations. A PHP server is required (with PHP JSON and SOAP), as well as a [National Rail LDBWS token](http://realtime.nationalrail.co.uk/OpenLDBWSRegistration/).

## Introducing Version 3!
Here we go again! It's time to rewrite this, again! This time it's in Vue.js and Laravel!

### Why Laravel? 
Why not! Sure, it's probably a bit overkill for this but it also makes things a tonne easier. 

### Why do you keep rebuilding this? V2 was perfectly fine!
It was. This project doesn't need to be rebuilt every year and yet here we are. This project has become more of a demonstration of where my abilities are at. It allows me to use the stuff that I've learnt over the past year, as well as experiment with things that I haven't had the chance to up until now (CSS Grid, for example.)

As you might've guessed, I spent the last year learning Laravel and Vue.js.
